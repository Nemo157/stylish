/// A trait for objects which are byte-oriented sinks and can handle attributed
/// data.
///
/// Writers are defined by two required methods, [`write`] and [`flush`]:
///
/// * The [`write`] method will attempt to write some data into the object,
///   returning how many bytes were successfully written.
/// * The [`flush`] method is useful for adaptors and explicit buffers
///   themselves for ensuring that all buffered data has been pushed out to the
///   'true sink'.
///
/// [`write`]: Write::write
/// [`flush`]: Write::flush
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use stylish::{io::Write, Foreground, Color, Style};
///
/// let data = b"some bytes";
/// let style = Style::default().with(Foreground(Color::Blue));
///     
/// let mut pos = 0;
/// let mut output = stylish::io::plain(std::io::stdout());
///
/// while pos < data.len() {
///     let bytes_written = output.write(&data[pos..], style)?;
///     pos += bytes_written;
/// }
///
/// output.flush()?;
/// # Ok::<(), std::io::Error>(())
pub trait Write {
    /// Write a buffer into this writer with a specified style, returning how
    /// many bytes were written.
    ///
    /// This function will attempt to write the entire contents of `buf`, but
    /// the entire write may not succeed, or the write may also generate an
    /// error. A call to `write` represents at most one attempt to write to
    /// any wrapped object, plus whatever is needed to change the style.
    ///
    /// Calls to `write` are not guaranteed to block waiting for data to be
    /// written, and a write which would otherwise block can be indicated
    /// through an [`Err`] variant.
    ///
    /// If the return value is `Ok(n)` then it must be guaranteed that `n <=
    /// buf.len()`. A return value of `0` typically means that the
    /// underlying object is no longer able to accept bytes and will likely
    /// not be able to in the future as well, or that the buffer provided is
    /// empty.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Each call to `write` may generate an I/O error indicating that the
    /// operation could not be completed. If an error is returned then no
    /// bytes in the buffer were written to this writer, but the writers
    /// state may have changed to match the new style.
    ///
